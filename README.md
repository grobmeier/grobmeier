### Hello!

I’m Christian Grobmeier — Open Source Developer, Author, and long-time contributor to the Apache Software Foundation, where I currently serve as VP of Data Privacy and on several project management committees.
As a Java Champion and Manning author, I write, teach, and maintain projects that keep systems reliable and communities connected.

In early 2025, I joined the first cohort of the [GitHub Secure Open Source Fund](https://github.blog/news-insights/company-news/announcing-github-secure-open-source-fund/), helping strengthen the security of [Apache Log4j](https://logging.apache.org) and related open-source projects.
My reflections on open source, resilience, and engineering culture live at [Logging Off](https://grobmeier.de).
