### Hello!

I'm Christian, an Open Source Developer and Trainer passionate about my work.

At the core of my involvement is the Apache Software Foundation, where I contribute to various projects. Additionally, I've developed "Time & Bill," a time tracking application tailored to meet European legal standards, and I'm excited to bring it into the Open Source community.

Connecting with like-minded individuals and collaborators is something I always look forward to. Feel free to reach out to me:
